## üóÑ Database structure (when used)

### PostgreSQL Schema Design

#### Core Tables

**Users Table**

```sql
users {
  id: String (CUID Primary Key)
  email: String (UNIQUE)
  full_name: String
  password_hash: String (bcrypt hashed)
  role: String (DEFAULT: "student")
  created_at: DateTime (DEFAULT: now())
  updated_at: DateTime (AUTO UPDATE)
}
```

**Categories Table**

```sql
categories {
  id: String (CUID Primary Key)
  user_id: String (Foreign Key ‚Üí users.id)
  name: String
  color: String (DEFAULT: "#3B82F6")
  created_at: DateTime (DEFAULT: now())
  updated_at: DateTime (AUTO UPDATE)

  UNIQUE(user_id, name) -- Prevent duplicate category names per user
}
```

**Tasks Table**

```sql
tasks {
  id: String (CUID Primary Key)
  user_id: String (Foreign Key ‚Üí users.id)
  category_id: String (Foreign Key ‚Üí categories.id, NULL allowed)
  title: String (Required)
  description: String (Optional)
  priority: Priority ENUM (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) DEFAULT MEDIUM
  status: Status ENUM (INCOMPLETE, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED) DEFAULT INCOMPLETE
  deadline_at: DateTime (Optional)
  estimate_minutes: Integer (Optional)
  completed_at: DateTime (AUTO SET on completion)
  created_at: DateTime (DEFAULT: now())
  updated_at: DateTime (AUTO UPDATE)
}
```

**Activity Logs Table**

```sql
activity_logs {
  id: String (CUID Primary Key)
  user_id: String (Foreign Key ‚Üí users.id)
  action: String (e.g., "TASK_CREATED", "TASK_COMPLETED")
  meta: JSON (Additional action metadata)
  created_at: DateTime (DEFAULT: now())
}
```

#### Database Relationships

- **User ‚Üí Categories**: One-to-Many (User can have multiple categories)
- **User ‚Üí Tasks**: One-to-Many (User can have multiple tasks)
- **User ‚Üí Activity Logs**: One-to-Many (User activity tracking)
- **Category ‚Üí Tasks**: One-to-Many (Category can contain multiple tasks)
- **Category Deletion**: Cascade delete (removes all related tasks)
- **Task Deletion**: Set category to NULL (preserves category structure)

#### Database Enums

```sql
-- Priority levels for task importance
Priority: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW

-- Task completion status
Status: INCOMPLETE | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETED
```

#### Indexes for Performance

```sql
-- User email lookup
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- Task queries by user
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_user_id ON tasks(user_id);

-- Task queries by status and priority
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_status ON tasks(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_priority ON tasks(priority);

-- Deadline-based queries
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_deadline ON tasks(deadline_at);

-- Category-based task grouping
CREATE INDEX idx_categories_user_id ON categories(user_id);
```
